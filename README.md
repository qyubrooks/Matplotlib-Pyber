## Background: Pyber Ridesharing Company

The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, I've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of my own. In my latest capacity, I'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, I'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

I've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

My objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, I will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
